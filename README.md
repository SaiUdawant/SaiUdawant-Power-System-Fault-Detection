# Power System Fault Detection and Classification

This project uses machine learning to detect and classify faults (e.g., line-to-ground, line-to-line) in power distribution systems using electrical measurement data.

## Technologies Used
- IBM Cloud Lite
- Python 3.11
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib
- Dataset from Kaggle

## Dataset
[Kaggle: Power System Faults Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ziya07/power-systemfaults-dataset)

## Objective
To develop an accurate and fast ML model that distinguishes between normal and faulty states of a power grid.
